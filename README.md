## About Prismatic

Prismatic is a dev-first integration platform that makes it easier for B2B software developers to build, deploy, and support integrations for their customers.

It addresses the hardest integration pain points so software teams can spend less time on integrations and more time on core product innovation.

**Prismatic is a solution for the real world**. It was designed to handle messy, complex integration scenarios and work with existing development and deployment toolchains. It is flexible and extensible, and can be used to build bespoke and vertical-specific integrations between applications of all kinds, SaaS or legacy, with or without a modern API, regardless of protocol or data format.

For information on the Prismatic platform, check out our [website](https://www.prismatic.io) and [docs](https://www.prismatic.io/docs).
